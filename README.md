# Face-Recognition
## Introduciton
A Face recognition sysytem was built using face recognition library. The model is able to detect faces and create a bounding box around each face. The model is also able to recognize the faces and label them correctly. Face recognition was done directly through webcam in real time.<br> 
Attendance project is also built alongside this project. After recognition of the faces in real time for the first time, it can enter the name of the person along with the time in an attendance excel sheet.
